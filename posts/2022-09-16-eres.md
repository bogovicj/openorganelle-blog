Work published by the Lippincott-Schwartz lab reveals the ultrastructure of sites (**ERES**: **E**ndoplasmic **R**eticulum **E**xit **S**ites) where proteins are trafficked from the ER to the Golgi<sup>1</sup>. As shown in the rendering<sup>2</sup> below, the orange ERES is a tangled tubule network connected to and exchanging content with the ER (shown in blue). Microtubules, the white hollow sticks, are also important for trafficking proteins on their journeys from the ER through the ERES and on to the Golgi.
